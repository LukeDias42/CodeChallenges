# data-structure-exercises
Just the solutions for some data structures exercise done in C (or other languages)

## For C solutions
Some solutions require the stack.c file to work correctly. I did not as of yet added a MAKEFILE, because I do not know how they work, so...
Anyway, to compile any of these files that depend on stack.c, simply:

``` bash
gcc [name_of_the_file].c stack.c -o [name_of_the_build].out
```

Then you can run the result using:

``` bash
./[name_of_the_build].out
```
Also, you might have to use the node_stack.c too, it follows the same idea.
